NOTE: Project was made with inches in mind. I might do the conversions at a later date, but you can also convert the results to centimeters by multiplying by ~2.54


This is a very simple python project (pretty much plug and play); Once you download the project and run it, it will ask for 3 sets of measurements: height, hip, and waist. 


Output will be a formatted table of data.


ex. (for inputs 74, 37.5, 34.75):

        cape length = 65.00
        correction ratio = 1.03
        standard chest = 41.27
        standard hip = 42.31
        hip deviation = -4.81
        back waist length = 19.09
        out seam = 45.91
        crotch depth = 9.89
        inseam = 36.02
        knee height = 20.01
        quarter hip = 9.38
        front crotch extension = 2.34
        back crotch extension = 5.69
        back rise extension = 1.63
        quarter waist = 8.69
        dart width = 0.84
        dart length = 3.30
        back waist width = 9.53
