NOTE: Project was made with inches in mind. I might do the conversions at a later date, but you can also convert the results to centimeters by multiplying by ~2.54


This is a very simple python project (pretty much plug and play); Once you download the project and run it, it will ask for 3 sets of measurements: height, hip, and waist. Output will be a formatted table of data.
